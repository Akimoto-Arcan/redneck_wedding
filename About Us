  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Howdy folks,</p>
  <p>We're Trey and Britt, the country sweethearts fixin' to throw the biggest bash this side of the county line, and we're downright thrilled y'all are hitchin' up with us for our good ol' fashioned redneck roundup of a wedding! Here's a little taste of who we are:</p>
  <p>Trey, he's the down-home boy with a knack for backyard barbecues and a love for all things outdoors. Whether he's out on the lake reelin' in the big ones or tendin' to the bonfire with a cold one in hand, he's always in his element. You'll spot him in his favorite camo hat, ready to crack a joke and make memories that'll last a lifetime.</p>
  <p>Now, Britt, she's the country cutie with a heart as big as her mama's pecan pie and a twang in her voice that'll make your heart skip a beat. She's got a passion for line dancin' and sweet tea sippin', and she ain't afraid to get a little mud on her boots. With her hair tied up in a messy bun and a smile that could light up the night sky, she's the life of the party, ready to raise some Cain and make this day one for the books.</p>
  <p>Together, we're just a couple of country kids with a whole lotta love to go 'round. So dust off them cowboy hats, shine up them boots, and get ready to kick up some dust with us on our big day!</p>
  <p>Can't wait to see y'all there!</p>
  <p>Trey & Britt</p>
